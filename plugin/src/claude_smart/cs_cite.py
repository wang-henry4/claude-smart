"""Support helpers for the ``cs-cite`` citation channel.

Context injected at SessionStart / PreToolUse tags each playbook and
profile bullet with a rank-based id fingerprinted by the underlying
real id (``[cs:r1-1a2b]`` for the first playbook rule whose
``user_playbook_id`` starts with ``1a2b``, ``[cs:p2-c3d4]`` for the
second profile preference). The injected instruction asks Claude to
end impactful replies with a call like::

    cs-cite p1-c3d4,r2-1a2b

via the Bash tool. The Stop hook later scans the session transcript for
those tool calls and resolves the ids against a per-session registry
persisted at ``~/.claude-smart/sessions/<session_id>.injected.jsonl``.

Why rank + fingerprint: rank alone resets at every injection, so a
later injection's ``r1`` would silently overwrite an earlier entry in
the append-only registry — if Claude cited ``r1`` across a turn
boundary, the resolver would pick the wrong playbook. Appending the
first four alphanumeric chars of the real id makes the id stable
across injections in the common case (distinct real ids → distinct
fingerprints), so cross-injection collisions become rare.

This module holds:

- ``rank_id``: ``p{n}-{fp}`` / ``r{n}-{fp}`` tag for a given
  (kind, rank, real_id) tuple. Fingerprint is omitted when no real id
  is available.
- ``CITATION_CMD_RE``: regex matching a valid ``cs-cite`` command line.
- ``ensure_installed``: idempotent copy of ``plugin/bin/cs-cite`` to
  ``~/.claude-smart/bin/cs-cite`` with the executable bit set.
- ``CITATION_INSTRUCTION``: the trailer text appended to injected
  context so Claude knows when and how to call the tool.
